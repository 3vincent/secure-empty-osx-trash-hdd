Secure Empty Trash under OS X for Hard Disk Drives

In OS X 10.11 El Capitan Apple has removed the option to securely empty the trash.   
This script can do this for you â€“ as long as you have a HDD (Hard Disk Drive).   
Solid State Drives are not supported by this, and it is useless to run this script on a SSD.  

This comes with no warranty.   

You can download the [OS X gui version here](https://github.com/3vincent/secure-empty-osx-trash-hdd/releases).

## 1. What is does

This script is basically a wrapper around the unix command srm. All it does is: 

1. Running the `srm` command (secure remove)  
2. Overwrite the content of `~/.Trash/` and the directory itself  
3. Recreate `~/.Trash/` 

Just run the script in a Terminal, or double click the .app.  


## 2. Download source and application

You can download the [latest source code](https://github.com/3vincent/secure-empty-osx-trash-hdd/archive/master.zip), it should be very readable, since it only is beginners bash code. 

Or you can go to the [release page](https://github.com/3vincent/secure-empty-osx-trash-hdd/releases) where you can also download a **"pre-compiled"** version of the script. 

Have fun erasing stuff
